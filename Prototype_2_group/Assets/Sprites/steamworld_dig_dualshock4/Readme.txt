SteamWorld Dig - Dualshock 4 button prompts

As game uses SDL2, it means Dualshock 4 works just fine with the game! 
However game only includes 360 button prompts, but that's really easily fixable as all the files are plain PNG files :p

--INSTALLATION--
This works at least with Windows version. Not entirely sure about OS X and Linux, but should work if you find identical file
- Go to [installation folder]\BundlePC\Sprites\buttons\ folder
- !! Backup "buttons_0[8888].png" file e.g. renaming it "buttons_0[8888].png.bak" !!
- Copy "buttons_0[8888].png" from this downloaded archive there. (If you want DS3 version, copy "_PS3" version and rename that part out)
- Launch the game and enjoy!

--VERSION HISTORY--
V1.0 - 12.10.2015
- First version, simple copy paste job from PS4 version screenshots. However: 
- Remade "Playstation" button, not sure if it's ever used anywhere but at least it's manually redone. 
- Remade "Share" buttons text. This one can't be used on PS4 version, PS4 uses touchpad button which doesn't work on PC version. 
- Made DS3 version with custom Start and Select buttons as I was too lazy to boot up PS3 version of the game and capture screens with capture card.
